# Importing and Exporting Components
The magic of components lies in their reusability: you can create components that are composed of other components. But as you nest more and more components, it often makes sense to start splitting them into different files. This lets you keep your files easy to scan and reuse components in more places.
## The root component file 
App.js file:
```React
import './App.css';
import "./index.css"
import Main from './Main';
import Sidebar from './Sidebar';
import Header from './Header';

export default function App(){
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Header/>
      <div>
        <Main userName = "Mack" num= {5} />
        <Sidebar />
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```
 In Create React App, your app lives in src/App.js. Depending on your setup, your root component could be in another file, though. If you use a framework with file-based routing, such as Next.js, your root component will be different for every page.

## Other files
Header.js:
```React
function Header(){
    return(
        <div>
            <p>Something header</p>
        </div>
    )
}

export default Header;
```
Main.js:
```React
function Main(){
    return(
        <div>
            <p>Something main</p>
        </div>
    )
}

export default Main;
```

Sidebar.js
```react
function Sidebar(){
    return(
        <div>
            Mark
        </div>
    )
}

export default Sidebar;
```

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
